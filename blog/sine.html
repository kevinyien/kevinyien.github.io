      <h1>Sinusoidal Thinking</h1>
      <p class="mutedTime">2021-05-31</p>

<p>In mathematics, sine waves help graph periodic oscillations. While they are commonly used in applications such as signal processing, I have found them to be an effective mental model for context switching. </p>

<p class="callout">I know this seems like a stretch, but I promise it sort of makes sense. And this is a short post anyway, so just keep reading.</p>

<p>Sine waves have an amplitude and frequency [1]. Simple tasks have low amplitudes. Complex tasks have high amplitudes. The more familiar you become with a given task, the higher the frequency you can handle (i.e. task-cycle efficiency). The integral of the curve is a measurement of impact. </p>

<p>If you increase the amplitude, you can achieve a similar integral with lower frequency. Some may recognize this as &quot;work smarter, not harder&quot;. The reality is that more complex roles have higher amplitudes <em>and</em> higher frequencies (i.e. maximizing the integral). Whether you are a director managing several teams or a senior individual contributor working on a large project, the amount of context switching you experience will monotonically increase. </p>

<p>This is bad, right?</p>

<p>Nope. </p>

<p>This is a feature, not a bug. </p>

<p>How is that possible? </p>

<p>Let's go back to the sine wave. Imagine one with a high amplitude and low frequency. Now imagine another with the same amplitude but a higher frequency. The linear distance between two equivalent points will be smaller on the latter. </p>

<p><img src="../img/sine.png" alt="two graphs with similar amplitudes demonstrating shorter distance between points with higher frequencies"></p>

<p>In other words, you can now connect dots and identify patterns faster than before — and in some cases connect dots you would not have been exposed to in the past. This is how you can turn context switching from a hindrance into an asset. The amplitude is going to increase as long as you continue to grow and push yourself. So focus on increasing your frequency [2]. </p>

<p>This is not a call to <em>intentionally</em> switch contexts more often. Instead, it is a way of extracting value from the fact that most roles <em>implicitly</em> require more context switching. </p>

<p class="callout">Forcing yourself out of flow is as useful as throwing firecrackers into the middle of an orchestra ensemble. </p>

<p>NOTES</p>

<p>[1] Sine waves have additional variables that can define their shape and behavior, but amplitude and frequency were sufficient for this example. If you really want, read more about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave">sine waves on Wikipedia</a>, or crack open that old high school geometry textbook. </p>

<p>[2] The exception is when you want to explicitly examine parts of your work in a different way. Similar to signal processing, forcing a change in frequency (often a reduction) exposes nuances in the signal that would otherwise be missed (i.e. reducing noise). This is useful as an explicit exercise, but less as a default mode of operation. </p>
